In this project we have a ultrasound sensor connected to 4x7seg display.
It also has a connected potentiometer to control the unit of the distance.

Depending on your 4x7seg display, you'll need to connect pins to 2-13 ports. 

Connect the potentiometer to:
+5V, A0, GND

Connect the ultrasound sensor:

trig -> 0 pin
echo -> 1 pin
gcc -> 5V
gnd -> GND
